# Power BI Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey with **Microsoft Power BI**.

I will be uploading Power BI reports that I create as part of my continuous learning process. Each report reflects hands-on practice with data modeling, DAX, visual design, and storytelling using Power BI.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in Power BI
- Practice creating meaningful and well-structured reports
- Track my progress over time
- Maintain a portfolio of learning-focused Power BI work

## What You’ll Find Here
- `.pbix` Power BI report files
- Practice dashboards and analytical reports
- Experiments with visuals, slicers, measures, and calculations
- Iterative improvements as my understanding evolves

## Notes
- This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production showcase.
- Reports may evolve, get refined, or even be replaced as I improve.
- Some datasets may be sample or publicly available data.

## Tools & Skills Practiced
- Power BI Desktop
- Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)
- Data modeling
- DAX basics and intermediate measures
- Report design and visualization best practices

## Progress
This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and building new reports.
